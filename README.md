# FungID
This is the API for FungID.  You can download the mobile apps for [ios](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fungid-mushroom-fungus-ids/1644525684) or [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.fungid.fungid_app). 

## Goals
This as a personal project and I intend it to be free forever.  My goal is to provide people with a high quality app that encourages them to get out, explore, and learn about the amazing world of fungi.

## Contributing.
If you are interested in helping to develop the api, please feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests.  As this is relatively new, there is a lot of low hanging fruit.  Any and all contributions are welcome.  Please feel free to reach out so I can help you to get started: michael@fungid.app
